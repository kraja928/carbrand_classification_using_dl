# carbrand_classification_using_dl
This project has been done using deep learning to identify the various brands of the car from multiple images.
The dataset is available in the kaggle website, however completing the datascience lifecycle through deployment is the main aim here.
The dataset is available in this repository with Datasets.zip folder.
This dataset contains 122 images that belongs to three different brands of cars.
Here in this project we have used transfer learning technique for the model to learn the brands of the car.
This helps in fast learning of the model, increase the accuracy.

When we are satisfied with learning of the model, we save this model in h5 format.

Note: All the machine learning models can be saved in pkl format, the deep learning models should be saved in h5 format, because the machine learning models are less in size where as the deep learning models are very high in size due to extensive training.
This model has beeen made to deploy in heroku platform and hence the corresponding Procfile and requirements.txt files have been created.
The application is deployed in heroku, the app link is not updated here as the minimum applications allowed to run on heroku has been exceeded.
